A single restaurant can service hundreds of people every day... even **_every hour_**!

### Things I care about most in a restaurant are:

1. Quality - Do I enjoy the food and drink?    
2. Speed - How fast can I get the things I want?    
3. Accurancy - Did everything come as I asked?    

To achieve this, restaurants analyze thousands of data points. All of these data are organized to see the basic trends of profitability, reviews, and popularity of items. However, there's a lot more to be read between the lines. Subtle cues in the data that can be read long before any potential successes or failures. This repository intends to show them.
